This plugin integrates [Composer] into the [Puli Repository Manager]. Whenever you
install or update your Composer dependencies, a Puli repository is generated 
from the puli.json files of the installed packages:

```json
{
    "resources": {
        "/acme/blog": "resources"
    }
}
```

You can include the generated repository in your code and access all exported
resources by their Puli paths:

```php
$repo = require __DIR__.'/vendor/resource-repository.php';

// /path/to/project/vendor/acme/blog/resources/config/config.yml
echo $repo->get('/acme/blog/config/config.yml')->getContents();
```
