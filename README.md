This plugin integrates the [Puli library] into [Composer]. Whenever you install
or update your Composer dependencies, a Puli repository is generated from the
composer.json files of the installed packages:

```json
{
    "name": "acme/blog",
    "extra": {
        "resources": {
            "/acme/blog": "resources"
        }
    }
}
```

You can include the generated repository in your code and access all exported
resources by their Puli paths:

```php
$repo = require __DIR__.'/vendor/resource-repository.php';

// /path/to/project/vendor/acme/blog/resources/config/config.yml
echo $repo->get('/acme/blog/config/config.yml')->getContents();
```
